# Bamazon-MySQL-Node-App
I was able to completemost of the minimum requirements of this assignment but I was unable to get my mysql database to update the new product stock quantity after a customer makes a purchase. I am getting a throw/catch error. It is in the screenshoots in my images folder. I felt much more comfortable with node during this assignment. 

Game Process: 

Type in node bamazoncustomer.js and the application will start. 
Prompts will ask you for which Item Id and the quantity of that item you would like to purchase. 
After selecting both the terminal will show the item the quantity and the price. I also have a console.log to show the 
new stock quantity. Which works inside my console.log within that same function but if I try to call that newStock in a seperate function I get my throw/catch error.
